# PurgeDB

PurgeDB is a utility for keeping track of filament purge values for printers that use multiple materials with a single extruder.

# Main Features

- Keeps a database of each type and color of filament you use
- Uses 1-3 colors along with name for better visibility
- Save purge values (in mm^3) for any pair of filaments
- Set up the filaments in the same order as Orca Slicer
- Press "Send to Orca" and the app will alt-tab and input the purge values ("Flushing Volumes" window must be open, with the cursor in the first entry)
